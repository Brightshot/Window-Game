!!Important Note!!
____________________

1.The Transparency effect only affects completely black areas of the game and works only on the built version
of the game.

2.Unfortunately it only works on windows OS " kinda of a coincidence considering the game is about 'Windows' XD " 
but the transperency effect uses windows system files to work,so it only runs on windows.
